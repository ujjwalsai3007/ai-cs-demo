# AI-Assisted Spring Boot Development - CTO Code Review Explanation

## Video Structure & Script for Loom Recording

### **PART 1: Project Setup & Database (2-3 minutes)**

#### **1.1 Database Migration Fix (V2__Fix_sequence_start.sql)**
**Show on screen:** `src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__Fix_sequence_start.sql`

**What to say:**
"Starting with the CTO's feedback about sequence numbers starting from 50 instead of 1. I created a new Flyway migration V2 to fix this. This migration resets the PostgreSQL sequence to start from 1 and clears existing data for a clean start. This demonstrates proper database version control using Flyway migrations."

**AI Generated vs Manual Changes:**
- **AI Generated:** The migration SQL syntax and approach
- **Manual Changes:** I refined the sequence restart logic and added comments for clarity

---

#### **1.2 Original Database Schema (V1__Create_products_table.sql)**
**Show on screen:** `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__Create_products_table.sql`

**What to say:**
"Here's our original schema using PostgreSQL-specific syntax with GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY for auto-incrementing IDs, rather than MySQL's AUTO_INCREMENT. I also added an index on the title field for efficient searching."

---

### **PART 2: Backend Service Layer (3-4 minutes)**

#### **2.1 Scheduled Job (ProductService.kt)**
**Show on screen:** `src/main/kotlin/org/example/aicsdemo/service/ProductService.kt` (lines 35-94)

**What to say:**
"Our scheduled service runs with initialDelay=0 for immediate execution at startup, then every hour. It implements business logic to limit products to 50, fetches from famme.no JSON API, and handles error scenarios gracefully. Notice how we extract the first variant's price and store both structured data and raw JSON for flexibility."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- `@Scheduled(initialDelay = 0, fixedDelay = 3600000)`
- Product count checking before fetching
- Error handling with try-catch
- JSON processing with ObjectMapper

---

#### **2.2 Enhanced Controller (ProductController.kt)**
**Show on screen:** `src/main/kotlin/org/example/aicsdemo/controller/ProductController.kt`

**What to say:**
"I enhanced the controller with multiple features. First, the delete functionality now has two endpoints - one returning JSON for API responses and another for HTMX updates. The export feature generates CSV files with proper headers and escaping. All endpoints follow RESTful conventions."

**AI Generated vs Manual Changes:**
- **AI Generated:** Basic CRUD endpoints structure
- **Manual Changes:** Added proper error handling, dual delete endpoints, CSV escaping logic, and ResponseEntity configuration

**Key Sections to Show:**
1. **Delete Enhancement (lines 49-65):** Dual endpoints for JSON and HTMX responses
2. **Export Feature (lines 109-134):** CSV generation with proper headers and timestamp
3. **Update Product (lines 75-95):** Form handling with validation

---

### **PART 3: Frontend Implementation (4-5 minutes)**

#### **3.1 Enhanced Product Table (fragments/product-table.html)**
**Show on screen:** `src/main/resources/templates/fragments/product-table.html`

**What to say:**
"The product table now includes enhanced delete confirmation using Shoelace dialog components, export functionality, and toast notifications for user feedback. Instead of basic browser confirm dialogs, we use Shoelace's modern dialog system."

**AI Generated vs Manual Changes:**
- **AI Generated:** Basic table structure and HTMX integration
- **Manual Changes:** Sophisticated delete confirmation dialog, toast notification system, export button integration

**Key Features to Demonstrate:**
1. **Table Header:** Product count and export button
2. **Delete Confirmation:** Custom Shoelace dialog with product name
3. **JavaScript Functions:** `confirmDelete()`, `deleteProduct()`, `exportProducts()`, `showToast()`

---

#### **3.2 Search Page (search.html)**
**Show on screen:** `src/main/resources/templates/search.html`

**What to say:**
"The search page implements real-time search using HTMX. As users type, it triggers requests to the backend without page refreshes. The styling uses CSS custom properties for theming and Shoelace components for consistency."

**Key Features:**
- HTMX `hx-trigger="keyup changed delay:300ms"`
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Responsive design with modern aesthetics

---

#### **3.3 Edit Product Page (edit-product.html)**
**Show on screen:** `src/main/resources/templates/edit-product.html`

**What to say:**
"The edit page allows updating product details with form validation. It uses Thymeleaf for server-side rendering and maintains the same design language as the rest of the application."

---

### **PART 4: Live Application Demo (3-4 minutes)**

#### **4.1 Running from IntelliJ in Debug Mode**
**Show on screen:** IntelliJ Run Configuration

**What to say:**
"Running the application in IntelliJ debug mode rather than terminal allows proper debugging capabilities. I'll set a breakpoint in the ProductService to show the scheduled job execution."

**Steps to Show:**
1. Open Run/Debug Configurations
2. Set breakpoint in `fetchAndSaveProducts()` method
3. Run in debug mode
4. Show debugger hitting breakpoint

---

#### **4.2 Web Application Demonstration**
**Show on screen:** Browser at http://localhost:8080

**What to say:**
"Now let's see the application in action. The homepage loads with our modern UI using Shoelace components."

**Demo Flow:**
1. **Load Products:** Click "Load Products" button - show HTMX table population
2. **Add Product:** Fill form and submit - show real-time table update without page reload
3. **Search Functionality:** Navigate to search page, type in search box - show real-time filtering
4. **Edit Product:** Click edit button, modify details, save - show successful update
5. **Delete with Confirmation:** Click delete, show custom dialog, confirm deletion
6. **Export Feature:** Click export button, show CSV download

---

### **PART 5: Technical Architecture Discussion (2-3 minutes)**

#### **5.1 Technology Stack Integration**
**What to say:**
"This application demonstrates modern full-stack development patterns. The backend uses Spring Boot with Kotlin for type safety and conciseness. PostgreSQL provides robust data persistence with Flyway handling schema migrations. The frontend combines server-side rendering with Thymeleaf for SEO benefits, HTMX for dynamic interactions without JavaScript complexity, and Shoelace for consistent web components."

#### **5.2 AI Development Process**
**What to say:**
"Throughout development, I used AI assistance for initial code generation but manually refined critical areas. For example, AI generated the basic CRUD structure, but I manually added sophisticated error handling, proper PostgreSQL syntax, and enhanced user experience features like the custom delete confirmation dialog."

---

## **Key Talking Points for CTO:**

### **What AI Generated:**
1. Basic controller endpoint structure
2. Initial Thymeleaf template layouts
3. Standard Spring Boot configurations
4. Basic HTMX integration patterns

### **What I Manually Enhanced:**
1. PostgreSQL-specific database syntax and migrations
2. Sophisticated error handling and validation
3. Custom Shoelace dialog implementations
4. CSV export with proper escaping and headers
5. Dual endpoint patterns (JSON + HTMX)
6. Toast notification system
7. Business logic for product count limits
8. Responsive CSS with custom properties

### **Architectural Decisions:**
1. **Why PostgreSQL over H2:** Production-ready database with proper indexing
2. **Why HTMX over React/Vue:** Simpler maintenance, server-side rendering benefits
3. **Why Shoelace:** Consistent web components without framework lock-in
4. **Why Flyway:** Database version control and deployment safety

### **Production Readiness Features:**
1. Proper error handling throughout the stack
2. Input validation and sanitization
3. Responsive design for mobile compatibility
4. Accessible UI components with proper ARIA attributes
5. Database indexing for performance
6. Logging for monitoring and debugging

## **Recommended Recording Tips:**

1. **Pace:** Spend 30-45 seconds per file, explaining the key concepts
2. **Code Focus:** Highlight the important methods and annotations
3. **Browser Demo:** Show smooth interactions without rushing
4. **Debug Mode:** Actually hit a breakpoint to show debugging capability
5. **File Navigation:** Use IntelliJ's file tree to show project structure

**Total Video Length:** 12-15 minutes for comprehensive coverage
